# websocket.nim

A websocket library for nim, providing both client and server support.

This is a pre-release and not final software. There might be bugs,
unintended side-effects, the API might change without warning between releases,
and features are missing - namely:

 * A robust RNG for the client data masking
 * Non-fin/continuation frames aren't supported yet

See the api docs linked on github for usage instructions.
